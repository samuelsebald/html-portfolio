   <h3>
    Spirited Away   
   </h3>
   <p>
   Spirited Away is a dazzling, enchanting, and gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by the world around them.   
   </p>
   <h3>
   Interstellar   
   </h3>
   <p>
   A big-budget reprise of ideas Nolan has been exploring since the beginning of his career. Not only is it a film about the passage of time, it's also a film about memory.

   <h3>
   Your Name
   </h3>
   <p>
   Sustains an aching adolescent yearning that plays like a Ryusuke Hamaguchi drama with an animated teen cast.
