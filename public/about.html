<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Back when I was a little lad in elementary, I already knew I wanted to become a full-stack expert with severe insights into the underlying mechanics of what powers the modern web. My parents told me such shenanigans where of utmost unimportance, yet I persisted through adversity and one day received an entire Udemy account from my most legendary friend - Mauritz. Not only that, but this account also included 2 courses that would help me realize my dream. Now, I'll become the webslayer and upgrade my personal website.  </p>
